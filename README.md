# Machine Learning Quality Evaluation for Machine Learning Systems 

## Thesis Objective

Evaluating the quality of ML classification algorithms for 17 different classifiers from Spark ML, Keras, and Scikit-learn to detect or minimize ML bugs at an early stage before a model is deployed. This can be achieved by testing the Code, the Model, and the Data and evaluating the individual classifiers using ML quality attributes using three popular classification datasets 

## Scikit-Learn Classifiers
## Spark ML classifiers
## Keras Classifier 


## Evaluation Metrics

## Set of Tools
